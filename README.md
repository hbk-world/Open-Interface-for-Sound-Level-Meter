#### *Documentation and programming examples*

This repository contains documentation and examples, how to control the B&K2245 and the HBK2255 sound level meter (SLM) via the WebXi interface. The SLM is developed and designed by Hottinger Brüel & Kjær (https://hbkworld.com).

The SLM has two main network interfaces supporting the HTTP based WebXi protocol: Wired (USB/Ethernet) and Wi-Fi.

Programming examples are provided as Python and C#/.Net.

Without the license installed on the SLM it will still be possible to access a limited set of parameters. Accessing the full functionality of the SLM requires a license to be installed on to the SLM; a license which is linked to the serial number of the SLM.

Please consult the [Documentation](Documentation) folder for information and how to get started.
